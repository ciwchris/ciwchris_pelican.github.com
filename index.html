                    <p>Notes from the Pluralsight course <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/understanding-eliminating-technical-debt">Understanding and Eliminating Technical Debt</a></p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Technical Debt</p>
<ul>
<li>The quick way versus the "right" way</li>
<li>Speeds up in the short term but slows down future development</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical debt is comparable to financial debt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get it now =&gt; Early to market</li>
<li>Pay interest =&gt; Refactoring</li>
<li>Unable to repay =&gt; Unable to maintain</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/XeS6">Ward Cunningham on Technical Debt</a></p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/fmB2b">Martian Fowler's Debt Quadrant</a></p>
<h2>Types</h2>
<ul>
<li>Code: What was the developer thinking? We spend more reading code than writing it. Readability matters!<ul>
<li>Complicated</li>
<li>Cut and paste</li>
<li>Tight coupling</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Architectural: Flexibility matters, requirements change.<ul>
<li>Missing layer: big ball of mud. Untested business logic.</li>
<li>Missing extensibility points: Open closed principle</li>
<li>Overlooked concern</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Knowledge: What does it do, how it works, who's using it: Code archaeologist. Lost Knowledge must be recovered.<ul>
<li>Dead code: red herring</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test: Quick and thorough or can't verify it is still working.</li>
<li>Technological: Support new and migrate from old technologies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Metrics</h2>
<p>How can we measure lost productivity as a result of technical debt? <a href="http://goo.gl/gAq1Yx">We have no way of reasonably measuring productivity</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Time<ul>
<li>Velocity = Work / Time</li>
<li>Decrease velocity: bad estimates, laziness, technical debt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Code<ul>
<li>Bad: poor measure of productivity and functionality</li>
<li>Good: the larger the code the more likely problems will be experienced</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cyclomatic: Hard to maintain and test</li>
<li>Code churn: Lots of changes to the same file or lots of authors of the same file.<ul>
<li>Too many responsibilities (SRP)</li>
<li>Lack of extensibility (Open Closed)</li>
<li>Lots of bugs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test metrics: trend of automated tests, manual test cases run and configuration coverage.</li>
<li>Code coverage: aim for 100% of business logic</li>
<li>Defect database<ul>
<li>How many bugs were found</li>
<li>How many found in production</li>
<li>Which file is regularly being bug fixed</li>
<li>How quickly were they resolved, the longer it took could point to more debt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Communicating</h2>
<p>Developer responses</p>
<ul>
<li>Cynical: it's hopeless</li>
<li>Critical: it's your fault</li>
<li>Cautious: too risky to change anything</li>
<li>Cavalier: let me at it</li>
<li>Clueless: what problem</li>
</ul>
<p>Incremental improvement. Don't try to fight it by yourself.</p>
<p>The longer we leave it the more time it costs us and the harder it is to fix.</p>
<p>Can't aim for no technical debt, we need to be pragmatic and strategic in what we attack.</p>
<p>Make it visible</p>
<ul>
<li>We are strategically taking on technical debt.</li>
<li>Two estimates: one doing it right and one taking on the debt.</li>
<li>Technical debt is slowing me down right now.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Action plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>Knowing the current state of the system.</li>
<li>Knowing what's coming in the future allows you to repay the appropriate technical debt.</li>
<li>Know what we are working towards, what is our aim to prevent and address technical debt. Learn lessons from the past.</li>
</ul>
<p>Needs to be continually evolved and improved over the course of the project.</p>
<h4>Technical Document</h4>
<p>A document gives visibility to others and gives developers insight to the trade-offs and whether it truly needs to be addressed.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the problem: how is it slowing us down</li>
<li>Proposed solution: what steps can we take</li>
<li>Estimate: quick or a lot of work</li>
<li>Benefit: allow other features to be implemented more quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>Good to review before starting new versions</p>
<h2>Repaying</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cover it with tests then modify it<ul>
<li>I don't have time: it will cost more time later</li>
<li>Don't know what it's doing: characterization tests</li>
<li>Can't get it under test: working with legacy code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make it extensible then extend it: refactor it in steps instead of changing everything at once.</li>
<li>Modularise then rewrite: small portions at a time.<ul>
<li><a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Micro services</a>: easily replaceable and can vary while monoliths are hard to maintain.</li>
</ul>

                    <h4>Estimating Puzzles</h4>
<p>Sometimes I feel software estimates are like estimating the time to solve a jigsaw puzzle. I've solved similar puzzles but I still can't give an accurate estimate for solving this one. I have an idea, I can use my project planning experience to breakdown the assembly of the puzzle into tasks. One task to find all the edge pieces and one task to assemble the edge pieces. That sounds reasonable. Hmm... creating tasks to assemble the center pieces is more challenging. It seems my estimates will need to be less precise or they will need to be less accurate...</p>
<h4>Estimating Software</h4>
<p>As software developers we are asked to give an estimate on the length of time it will take us to complete a task. Some tasks are easier to estimate than others. The more known the task, the more familiar the work necessary to complete the task, and the more narrowly focused the task all help to create a more precise estimate which is also more accurate. Other tasks carry a high risk. Usually these tasks are worked on first so the risk can be addressed early. The early work leads to a better understanding of what will be needed to address the risk, from which decisions can be made, before negative consequences originating from the risk have serious impact.</p>
<h4>Current Status</h4>
<p>I'm currently working on a set of related tasks which are high risk. Little was known about the specifics needed to complete the tasks. We are now at the end of our iteration, modest progress was made and I feel like a failure. In some environments I'd feel better about the lack of progress than others. In the current environment I am discouraged. Statistic documents will be created. Success will be determined by how accurately our actual work hours matches our estimates. I concede estimates are necessary, unfortunately, but there is a choice on how to use the estimates. It's easy to abuse estimates. Let's find the real value of estimates. Then we all can be happy, or at least not failures.</p>

<ul>
<li>Click and record makes for a nice sales demo but doesn't really have any sustainability</li>
<li>Don't start by automating everything. Start with what will help manual testers the most, which may be populating test data.</li>
<li>Don't just get to the finish line. Create a test framework which is maintainable by others</li>
<li>NCurve effect: starts steep then after the top there is a gradual decline. Writing the first test is like going up the steep slope.</li>
<li>Manual testing will never go away. Automated testing frees testers from the mundane and allows them to be creative.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gregpaskal.com/mets/">METS</a>: minimal essential testing strategy.</li>
<li>Biggest problem: using tools as discovered not as designed. Set aside budget and time to learn them. Training.</li>

<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a></p>
<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul>
<li>Master software engineers have the ability to organize programs so that they can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes will perform the tasks intended.</li>
<li>The most significant of these features is the fact that Lisp descriptions of processes, called procedures, can themselves be represented and manipulated as Lisp data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and data. (Later we will discover that they are really not so distinct.)</li>
<li>substitution model</li>
<li>normal-order evaluation vs applicative-order evaluation</li>
<li>The word predicate is used for procedures that return true or false, as well as for expressions that evaluate to true or false.</li>
<li>The contrast between function and procedure is a reflection of the general distinction between describing properties of things and describing how to do things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the distinction between declarative knowledge and imperative knowledge.</li>

<li>lexical scoping</li>

<ul>
<li>linear recursive process vs linear iterative process</li>
<li>It will execute an iterative process in constant space, even if the iterative process is described by a recursive procedure. An implementation with this property is called tail-recursive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.3</h2>
<ul>
<li>Procedures that manipulate procedures are called higher-order procedures.</li>
<li>Experienced programmers know how to choose procedural formulations that are particularly perspicuous, and where useful elements of the process are exposed as separate entities that can be reused in other applications.</li>
<li>expert programmers know how to choose the level of abstraction appropriate to their task.</li>
<li>Lisp, unlike other common programming languages, awards procedures full first-class status. This poses challenges for efficient implementation, but the resulting gain in expressive power is enormous.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul>
<li>The general technique of isolating the parts of a program that deal with how data objects are represented from the parts of a program that deal with how data objects are used is a powerful design methodology called data abstraction.</li>
<li>closure -- that the glue we use for combining data objects should allow us to combine not only primitive data objects, but compound data objects as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data abstraction is a methodology that enables us to isolate how a compound data object is used from the details of how it is constructed from more primitive data objects.</li>
<li>Data objects constructed from pairs are called list-structured data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>The word nil is a contraction of the Latin word nihil, which means 'nothing.'</li>
<li>The difference between the two definitions is not that the computer is performing a different process (it isn't) but that we think about the process differently. In effect, map helps establish an abstraction barrier that isolates the implementation of procedures that transform lists from the details of how the elements of the list are extracted and combined.</li>
<li>In working with compound data, we've stressed how data abstraction permits us to design programs without becoming enmeshed in the details of data representations, and how abstraction preserves for us the flexibility to experiment with alternative representations.</li>
<li>The value of expressing programs as sequence operations is that this helps us make program designs that are modular, that is, designs that are constructed by combining relatively independent pieces.</li>
<li>stratified design, the notion that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages. Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are used as primitives at the next level.</li>
<li>Stratified design helps make programs robust, that is, it makes it likely that small changes in a specification will require correspondingly small changes in the program.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.3</h2>
<ul>
<li>Symbolic differentiation is of special historical significance in Lisp. It was one of the motivating examples behind the development of a computer language for symbol manipulation. </li>
<li>We can represent trees by using lists. Each node will be a list of three items: the entry at the node, the left subtree, and the right subtree.</li>
<li>We have examined options for using lists to represent sets and have seen how the choice of representation for a data object can have a large impact on the performance of the programs that use the data.</li>
<li>The designer can create an initial implementation using a simple, straightforward representation such as unordered lists. This will be unsuitable for the eventual system, but it can be useful in providing a 'quick and dirty' data base with which to test the rest of the system. Later on, the data representation can be modified to be more sophisticated. If the data base is accessed in terms of abstract selectors and constructors, this change in representation will not require any changes to the rest of the system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.4</h2>
<ul>
<li>These data-abstraction barriers are powerful tools for controlling complexity. By isolating the underlying representations of data objects, we can divide the task of designing a large program into smaller tasks that can be performed separately. </li>
<li>So in addition to the data-abstraction barriers that isolate representation from use, we need abstraction barriers that isolate different design choices from each other and permit different choices to coexist in a single program. </li>
<li>Our main technique for building generic procedures will be to work in terms of data objects that have type tags, that is, data objects that include explicit information about how they are to be processed.</li>
<li>The principle of least commitment: The abstraction barrier formed by the selectors and constructors permits us to defer to the last possible moment the choice of a concrete representation for our data objects and thus retain maximum flexibility in our system design.</li>
<li>The general strategy of checking the type of a datum and calling an appropriate procedure is called dispatching on type.</li>
<li>data-directed programming: Here we will implement the interface as a single procedure that looks up the combination of the operation name and argument type in the table to find the correct procedure to apply, and then applies it to the contents of the argument.</li>
<li>message passing: An alternative implementation strategy is to decompose the table into columns and, instead of using 'intelligent operations' that dispatch on data types, to work with 'intelligent data objects' that dispatch on operation names.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.5</h2>
<ul>
<li>Often the different data types are not completely independent, and there may be ways by which objects of one type may be viewed as being of another type. This process is called coercion.</li>
<li>In general, we can implement this idea by designing coercion procedures that transform an object of one type into an equivalent object of another type.</li>
<li>hierarchy of types, in which, for example, integers are a subtype of rational numbers</li>
<li>in which each type has at most one supertype and at most one subtype. Such a structure, called a tower,</li>
</ul>
<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul>
<li>In particular, we need strategies to help us structure large systems so that they will be modular, that is, so that they can be divided 'naturally' into coherent parts that can be separately developed and maintained.</li>
<li>The first organizational strategy concentrates on objects, viewing a large system as a collection of distinct objects whose behaviors may change over time. An alternative organizational strategy concentrates on the streams of information that flow in the system, much as an electrical engineer views a signal-processing system.</li>
<li>The difficulties of dealing with objects, change, and identity are a fundamental consequence of the need to grapple with time in our computational models.</li>
<li>delayed evaluation: The stream approach can be most fully exploited when we decouple simulated time in our model from the order of the events that take place in the computer during evaluation.</li>
