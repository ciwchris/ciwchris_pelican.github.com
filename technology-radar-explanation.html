            <h3>Purpose</h3>
<ul>
<li>Why it's on the radar?</li>
<li>Why it was assigned its current status?</li>
<li>What is going to be done about it between now and the next radar period?</li>
<li>Where will it be the next radar radar period?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Techniques</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continuous deployment: Releases are large and risky. A single feature may be dragged down by other features which causes a lengthy delay between when a request comes in and it is deployed to the user. Continuous deployment would cut down the risk of what is changing between deployments and give the user what they want much quicker. This appears to be a beneficial technique but buy off is needed and there are risks. We don't have a process currently in place to allow us to understand features accurately nor do we have automated tests setup to verify previous functionality. Therefore a complete regression test should be made before each deployment, currently. Initial exploration should be made to determine what risks can be reduced by including comprehensive tests which are run in automated builds. I don't foresee any movement within the next radar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Done: During planning tasks are written for stories and are accomplished over the course of the iteration. But other tasks may be discovered during work. Also, the other tasks, such as testing, are not often considered when answering the question if a story is done. As a result an item is often considered finished and focus shifts elsewhere when in fact the original work was never completed which leads to bugs, defects and a product delivered to the user which does not function as originally requested. Therefore we should only accept a story as complete when a list of things can be said about it: 
requirements written, coded, has some tests written, they are passing and are being exercised in a build, a test report is accessible, can be deployed through the build system without intervention, has been signed off by QA and the changes have been captured in release notes. This is an item which can be improved immediately. A subset of the list can be selected and the story's status can only be considered done what it satisfies the items on this list. This item will remain in trial status until a satisfactory definition of done is determined and can be met successfully during development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acceptance driven development: Project requests are received without a firm understanding of what is being requested. Work begins, in spite of this, and testing occurs and understanding about the request is still hazy. Acceptance tests will force us to firmly write out what will be implemented. This understanding can then be shared amongst all parties. Also, these tests can be continuously run to verify new functionality developed does not impact previous functionality without having to perform a complete regression test. This will give the developer, as well as everyone else, better peace of mind when changes are made to a project. Specifications can start being written in this fashion immediately, but there will be initial difficulty structuring these specifications in such a fashion that they can most naturally be made use of within an acceptance testing framework. Therefore an initial trial of this process can be tried this period and then enhanced the next period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Database migrations: Changes to the database can be difficult to track, especially when several people are making changes to the database. It then needs to be determined what changes need to be made to the database during a deployment. Managing this by hand is time consuming and error prone. Therefore changes to a database should be made through a migration system and ran during deployments, or a script generated for production deployments. A migration system can be made use of immediately. It will take further coordination to run migrations in builds though. Once used during application development this item can be assessed, improvements made and then determined if it should be adopted. Potentially this could be adopted as a practice beginning next period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vertical slice testing: Unit testing tends to be rigid, forcing lots of modifications when a change to the application is made. Often this mean the tests are abandoned, any usefulness they had are lost and the developer loses confidence in writing any tests to begin with. Therefore testing should be performed in slices instead. All of the layers of the application can be tested together. Any dependencies can be replaced by in-memory versions so that the run time of tests remains low. Since layers are tested together the risk of test rework needing to be done when modifications are made are lower and are simpler. This item should be explored further, incorporating it within acceptance tests. Either this practice can be adopted while adopting acceptance tests or acceptance tests should be adopted before this item is tried.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeoman: Yeoman is a promising tool for efficiently creating and working with web applications. It recently reached version 1.0 and is therefore stable enough to build upon so that any breaking changes, which may cause rework or relearning, should be at a minimum. Now is an excellent period to invest more time in this tool by prototyping sample applications which will lead to exposure in scaffolding, managing dependencies and writing tests. After this period enough knowledge should be gained to determine the benefits of using Yeoman within a .Net application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pedestal: Pedestal is a framework for ClojureScript. While exploring ClojureScript it seems ideal to use this framework as a starting point for learning. An excellent tutorial has been created which can be stepped through which touches the various features of the framework. The goal is to eventually follow this tutorial to the end, if not within this period then within the next.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PowerShell: PowerShell is the scripting language of choice on Windows. Scriptcs, a C# scripting language, is intriguing but it is doubtful it will have the wide acceptance and usability which PowerShell does. Therefore proficiency with PowerShell is beneficial. Continued exposure to its syntax will be necessary for me to build up my comfort level with the language so when a problem arises it will not be a roadblock being able to use it. To do this existing scripts can periodically be reviewed and recreated. Afterwards more structured learning can take place to better understand the capabilities of the language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ClojureScript: ClojureScript is very intriguing. Being able to write client side script in a language other than JavaScript, and in a language as powerfull as Clojure, is attractive. Having had an interest in Clojure in the past, but not pursing it far, makes this a tempting way to get a foot in the door into the Clojure world. How ClojureScript would be usable within Yeoman is unknown, but is not an answer to pursue this period. Only the very basics should be explored, being able to get a web application up and running. After this more thought can be given to the feasibility of using it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Platforms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Android: Becoming knowledgeable with a mobile platform is incredibly important and needs to become a priority. Xamarin tools, in the long run, appear to be the best direction to peruse, being that you can reuse much of your application code across multiple platforms as well as my existing knowledge of C# and Visual Studio. But it seems prudent to first become familiar, and comfortable, in a framework in its native form. Android is the obvious choice for me, being that my current phone is Android and I don't have an Apple or Windows machine to develop with. To begin it would be ideal to become familiar with fragments, action bar, drawer, notifications and networking. Once becoming familiar with the basic usage of these features new features can slowly be added, building up skill and experience.</li>
