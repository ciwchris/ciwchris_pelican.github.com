I became intrigued by the idea of creating a [Technology Radar](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) while listening to [Neal Ford](nealford.com) on the [Relevance Podcast](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/07/26/neal-ford-of-thoughtworks-episode-036). Initially the plan was to [create a radar](http://nealford.com/memeagora/2013/05/28/build_your_own_technology_radar.html) for our department at work. My thinking was that it would give focus to developers, which technology to concentrate on and which should be used in projects, as well as give visibility as to what directions developers are exploring, and therefore what may start appearing in projects. It would also give management a good visual, and explanation if we did a write up, as to what we are using and where we are heading. It's questionable whether any action will be taken to create one but after reading the section on creating a *Personal Radar* I became motivated to create my own.

Why did I create my own radar? I consume information from a variety of sources. As a result I'm exposed to many interesting topics and ideas. I've come to realize it is too many. I tend to find one interesting topic, begin to pursue it only to be interrupted by the next interesting thing to come my way. In the end I have an awareness of many things but have learned none. I therefore concluded that I needed to focus on a small number of items, but still allow myself to be exposed to other items as well. I decided a *Personal Radar* may help me do just that. Each quarter, or perhaps twice a year, I will update a personal radar. The items I focus on will be selected from the radar. When I produce the next radar then I will select a new set of items to focus on. My hope is that I may become disciplined and learn an item more in-depth before moving on to the next interesting thing. So without further delay, below is my personal radar, probably for the remainder of the year, and explanation text, a work in progress.
