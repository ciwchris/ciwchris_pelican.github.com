#### Estimating Puzzles

Sometimes I feel software estimates are like estimating the time to solve a jigsaw puzzle. I've solved similar puzzles but I still can't give an accurate estimate for solving this one. I have an idea, I can use my project planning experience to breakdown the assembly of the puzzle into tasks. One task to find all the edge pieces and one task to assemble the edge pieces. That sounds reasonable. Hmm... creating tasks to assemble the center pieces is more challenging. It seems my estimates will need to be less precise or they will need to be less accurate...

#### Estimating Software

As software developers we are asked to give an estimate on the length of time it will take us to complete a task. Some tasks are easier to estimate than others. The more known the task, the more familiar the work necessary to complete the task, and the more narrowly focused the task all help to create a more precise estimate which is also more accurate. Other tasks carry a high risk. Usually these tasks are worked on first so the risk can be addressed early. The early work leads to a better understanding of what will be needed to address the risk, from which decisions can be made, before negative consequences originating from the risk have serious impact.

#### Current Status

I'm currently working on a set of related tasks which are high risk. Little was known about the specifics needed to complete the tasks. We are now at the end of our iteration, modest progress was made and I feel like a failure. In some environments I'd feel better about the lack of progress than others. In the current environment I am discouraged. Statistic documents will be created. Success will be determined by how accurately our actual work hours matches our estimates. I concede estimates are necessary, unfortunately, but there is a choice on how to use the estimates. It's easy to abuse estimates. Let's find the real value of estimates. Then we all can be happy, or at least not failures.
