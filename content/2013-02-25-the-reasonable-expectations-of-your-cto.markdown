Summary: 

Notes from the presentation "The Reasonable Expectations of Your CTO" given by Uncle Bob: [Demanding Professionalism: Uncle Bob @ Philly .NET User Group](http://vimeo.com/56708193). The talk begins approximately 21 minutes in.

### Reasonable Expectations ###

- **Don't ship junk:** "But we had to make a mess to make the deadline." This is a bad trade off. Take the time, it will keep you going fast later.
- **Always be ready to ship:** Not all the features may be complete, but it is a business decision to ship it or not. We should always be ready, at any moment.
- **Stable Productivity:** It's easy to start a project fast. Inevitably you start slowing down more and more. Start and continue well.
- **Inexpensive adaptability:** A change in requirements should be cheap. It's called *soft*ware for a reason.
- **Continuous improvement:** Code should be left better. Could should not be left to rot.
- **Fearless competence:** Should not be afraid to change the code.
- **Extreme quality:** Should feel good about the work we did. This should be our first motivation.
- **Will not dump on QA:** QA should not find anything. Should be considered a failure if they do.
- **Automation:** QA shouldn't have to spend a day verifying everything in the application. Automation can perform this task.
- **Nothing fragile:** Shouldn't be afraid to touch something because you might break it.
- **Cover for each other:** Someone else should know what you know. If you are gone someone else should be able to perform your tasks.
- **Honest estimates:** Accurate versus precise. Don't say you can do something when you know you can't.
- **Say "No":** When it's wrong you need to say so.
- **Continuous aggressive learning:** Need to be at the front of change. We are responsible for our career.
- **Teaching:** We don't train new developers how to be developers. We leave them on their own. Teaching also helps us learn.

### Questions ###
- Are any of the expectations, by themselves, unreasonable?
- Any of these expectations standout? Any you felt more passionate about?
- Were any of the comments made, while unpacking the expectations, unreasonable?
- How well do we meet each expectation?
- For those expectations we are weak can we rank in priority order and then, beginning at the highest, make a change to improve our ability to meet the expectation?
