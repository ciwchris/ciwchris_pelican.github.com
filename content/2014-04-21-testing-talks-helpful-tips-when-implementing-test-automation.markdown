- Click and record makes for a nice sales demo but doesn't really have any sustainability
- Don't start by automating everything. Start with what will help manual testers the most, which may be populating test data.
- Don't just get to the finish line. Create a test framework which is maintainable by others
- NCurve effect: starts steep then after the top there is a gradual decline. Writing the first test is like going up the steep slope.
- Manual testing will never go away. Automated testing frees testers from the mundane and allows them to be creative.
- [METS](http://www.gregpaskal.com/mets/): minimal essential testing strategy.
- Biggest problem: using tools as discovered not as designed. Set aside budget and time to learn them. Training.
